## Software requirements

1. **Quarto 1.8** 

    We'll rely on some of the latest features of Quarto, so please ensure you have v1.8 installed. Download at: <https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease/>

2. **Positron, VS Code or RStudio** 

    We'll be live-coding in Positron, but we recognize that you probably already have an IDE you like to use with Quarto.
    If that IDE is one of Positron, VS Code or RStudio, stick with it.
    For Positron and VS Code ensure you have the Quarto ([OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/quarto/quarto) or [MS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto)) and
  Lua ([OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/sumneko/lua) or [MS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua)) extensions.
    
    If you use another IDE, be prepared to preview Quarto documents (`.qmd`), use the integrated terminal, and open and edit `.tex`, `.html`, and `.lua` files. 
    You might consider installing [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/download.html) as a backup in case you have trouble following along from your IDE.

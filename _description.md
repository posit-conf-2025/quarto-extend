In this workshop, we will dive deep into ways of customizing your Quarto outputs with tooling beyond built-in features. This workshop is designed for data scientists, analysts, and technical writers looking to extend Quarto's capabilities to suit their unique workflows better.

Participants will learn how to create custom extensions, including new formats, templates, and filters, to enhance their document production process. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, you'll gain practical skills in:

* Developing and integrating custom formats to support diverse outputs while reducing repetition across projects.
* Substituting Quarto's templates with your own to customize formats beyond the built-in options.
* Implementing filters to automate and streamline content transformation.

By the end of the workshop, you will be able to leverage Quarto's extensibility to create powerful, tailored solutions for your documentation needs. Whether you have just worked on a few Quarto projects or are an everyday user, this workshop will equip you with the tools and knowledge to take your document workflows to the next level.
